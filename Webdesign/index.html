    <h2>Why I am interested in Wrestling</h2>
        Wrestling has been the one sport that i have done for as long as i can remember. Which it is also the
        only sport that i dedicate myself to year around. I enjoy this sport cause it just me out there and there's
        no one i can blame if i lose or mess up. Also the discipline that comes with this sport isn't easy 
        which is another reason i love the sport cause its different from every other sport. But there 
        also isn't just one way to do it or to practice like other sports your style can be comepletely 
        different from everyone else including the coach. Its unique to you and the way you dedicate yourself 
        to the sport. Even though wrestling can be hard at times i still love it because it introduces you to knew people from all over
        and you also get to see how didfferent states or countrys around the world compete and how much different it is 
        from how you compete.

        <h3>Hobbies & interest</h3>
        1. <strong>Exercising</strong> which is one of the reasons i do wrestling because the exercise you can get from 
        wrestling is unlike any other sport. Also because it keeps me health and in shape for things like running evenst that
        happen during the summer. So i really enjoy wrestling and just ecercising over all.

        2. <strong>Playing Video Games</strong>: Its where i can just have fun with my friends and have a good time and not worry about anything else.
        Its also where my mind can just go free and take over and build whatever it wants if im playing a building game or if im
        playing a game with my friend and they just want to mess around. Playing vdeo games is really just my chance to get away
        from the world and just enjoy what i want to enjoy with no problems or errors just me having fun playing a game. 
        <br>

        3.<strong>Wood Working</strong>: has always been something i love to do because it just hands on and you have a free 
        mind to just build whatever you want and then have a finished product that you wanted and made.

        <h4>Future Goals</h4>
        Future Goals is something that i dont ever really think about because future can be 1 day or 1 year or
        even 1000 years away. But there has been one thing that i have thought about and thats going to college and 
        working to get some type of degree that will get me a job that pays well. Also if or when i do go to
        college i want to be involved with some sort of collegiate sport to not only stay health but to have
        as much fun as i can. Atleast before im completely done with school and have to work all day. There are some really unrealistic
        things that people would say like i was to be a pro video game player or say i want to be a youtuber. Well that also
        never becomes a reality so i just want a job thats realistic and pays well and i want to be able to support the people around me.
